* In this really simple project, these technologies were used:
Scss (Sass), Vue Components, Typescript, Jest (Unit Test)

* This project is more of about Sass (CSS) usage, basically. And also you might have an idea about a bit using of components too.

* There are two tests for components in tests/unit/components folder: **H3.spec.ts** and **Footer.spec.ts**. You can execute your test with **npm run test:unit**
